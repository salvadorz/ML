## Supervised Training

### Linear Regression

* [Linear Regression (Housing prices)](notebook_jupyter/linear_regression_house_prices.ipynb "Linear Regression Example with 3 approaches"): Provides 3 approaches for (ML Supervised) Linear regression. All Implementation are using Linear algebra and no usage of any external ML library.
  * Batch Gradient Descent
  * Stochastic Gradient Descent
  * Closed Form

### Naives Bayes

* [Naives Bayes (spam Filter)](notebook_jupyter/naives_bayes_spam_filter.ipynb "Naives Bayes Example for Spam filtering"): Provides and example of (ML Supervised) Naives Bayes. It uses `scikit` library an takes *Bernoulli Naive Bayes* approach.

### Support Vector Machine
